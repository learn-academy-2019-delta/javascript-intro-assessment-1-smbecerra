# ASSESSMENT 1: INTRO TO JAVASCRIPT
## Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A piece of reusable code. It's intended to reduce redundancy when writing code. 

  Researched answer: A function is used to provide instructions within a certain piece of code. It is reusable and intended to allow us to avoid rewriting code multiple times.  


2. What is a method?

  Your answer: A function that is a part of a class. 

  Researched answer: In OOP, a method is a function associated with a class. As a part of that class it defines a particular behavior within an instance in that class.


3. List 5 examples of JavaScript string methods.

  Your answer: indexOf(), length(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), 

  Researched answer: 
  
  1. indexOf() = Returns the index of the first occurance of the string 
  2. length() = Returns the length of the string 
  3. toUpperCase() = Capitalizes the string 
  4. toLowerCase() = Returns the string in all lowercase
  5. search() = Searches for a specified value and returns the position of the match 

4. List 5 examples of JavaScript array methods.

  Your answer: join(), delete(), toString(), push(), pop()

  Researched answer:
  
  1. join(): It joins all array elements into a string. 
  2. delete(): Not recommended for use, better alternatives include pop() or shift(). Deletes elements in the array. 
  3. toString(): Automatically converts an array into a comma separated string. 
  4. push(): Adds a new element toward the end of the array.
  5. pop(): Removes an element from the end of the array.


5. Explain the difference between accessor and mutator methods. Provide an example of each.

  Your answer: A mutator method changes the state of an object, the accessor fetches these changes. 

  Researched answer: An accessor accesses private data stored within an object. A mutator is a method with a public level of accessibility used to control and change the value of a private member of a class. 


6. Explain the difference between console.log() and return.

  Your answer: console.log() allows the programmer to see the output of the code within the console. Return ends a statement of code. 

  Researched answer: Return does not appear in the console, it simply ends a code loop. console.log() is for the programmer to see the output of code within the console. 


7. In regards to functions, what is an argument? What is the difference between an argument and a variable?

  Your answer: A variable is stored data, it is dynamic. An argument is a placeholder (or placeholders) for instructions. 

  Researched answer: An argument is values passed on to the function when it is invoked. 


8. Give a brief description of JavaScript as if you were explaining it to someone who doesn't know anything about programming.

  JavaScript makes the internet work, along with HTML & CSS. It is a very dynamic and continously evolving programming language that allows us to have the interactivity with websites that we currently do. 

  Researched answer: JS is a scripting language that makes our websites more complex and dynamic. It is what allows us to provide sites with content updates, interactive maps, 2D/3D graphics, and etc. It is also a continously evolving programming language that will continue to play an important role in the future of web development. 


9. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the rolls of each person?

  Your answer: Driver and Navigator. 

  Researched answer: In pair programming, the driver is the programmer writing the code, listening carefully to the navigators indications. The navigator communicates what code to write while also keeping an eye out for syntax errors. 


10. What is one thing we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Pair programming has been very helpful when learning how to solve the different types of problems we are tasked with. Being able to use two heads instead of one when is tremendously useful when coming across a problem that I might have the first steps toward solving but that might require more insight from my partner to completely figure out.
